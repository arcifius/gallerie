## Gallerie

##### Road map

- [x] Provide a gallery view of all previously uploaded images.
- [x] `on mobile & tablet` button which will prompt you to either access the camera and take a pic or select from files on device.
- [x] `on desktop` drag image to page to upload or click on a button which allows selection of multiple files on device.
- [ ] It would be nice if UI could handle rotation on devices.

### Frontend
